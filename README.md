# FoodApp

This is an attempt to recreate a design outlined here: https://dribbble.com/shots/6571883-Food-Delivery-App. Using pure Kotlin with some 3rd party libraries. 

Users can browse select and add items to their basket. This will give them total values and later they are able to amend, change their basket option. 

Please let me know if you are having any issues with deploying it on the device. Tested on - Pixel 3 API 28, Lenovo TAB M8 API 26. (Application is only available in vertical mode)
